September 2018","content":"\n## What is Jamdocs\n\nJamdocs is a documentation theme for Gridsome, built to spin up quick, beautiful and static documentation sites fast without hassle. Since there is no theming system for Gridsome yet, Jamdocs comes with Gridsome, plug-ins and packages as dependencies.\n\n## Local installation\n\nEven though Jamdocs is so simple, you dont really need to set it up localy (you could just fork it on github to edit styles and md-files) - if you want to change it up a bit I recommend setting up localy for a better developer experience.\n\nTo set up a new instance of Jamdocs, and start developing just clone the project from Github like, go to the directory and run gridsome:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/samuelhorn/jamdocs project-name\ncd project-name\ngridsome develop\n```\n"}},"context":{}}
